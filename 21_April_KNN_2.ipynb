        "###The main difference between Euclidean distance metric and Manhattan distance metric is the way they measure distance between two points.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It is computed as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the corresponding coordinates of the two points. In other words, it measures the shortest distance between two points as if you were drawing a straight line between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Manhattan distance, on the other hand, is the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding coordinates of the two points. It is so named because it is similar to the distance a taxi would travel in a city where streets run at right angles.\n",
        "\n",
        "###The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. In general, Euclidean distance works well when the data is well-spread out and there are no outliers, while Manhattan distance is more robust to outliers and works well in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
